Survey Data
===========

In addition to the wearable sensor data, daily survey about infant heart rate
sensor and infant leg movement sensors was collected. The survey was sent to
primary caregiver once per day for 3 days during the 72 hour data collection
of infant hear rate sensor data and infant leg movement sensor data. Surveys
were automatically sent via email or text message (per caregiver preference)
at 10 am eastern / 9 am central / 8 am mountain / 7 am pacific. The surveys
were sent after the sensors had been recording for 24, 48, and 72 hours. The
survey asked about the preceding 24-hour period. It asked whether the sensors
were worn for most of the time and about the daily activities of the infant
(whether or not it was a fairly typical 24 hours for the infant, estimates of
how much they napped and slept, how much they were in a car seat, swing or
other restraining device, how much they were in a moving car or stroller or
being carried, and whether or not their legs are swaddled during naps and
sleep). This survey was created by the workgroup.

A research assistant (RA) marked preferred contact and preferred method of contact
(email or text message) at visit, then surveys were sent automatically. Spanish
translation was available.

Survey data collection occurred at **V02 (0-1 months of age)** and at **V03
(3-8 months of age)**.

Quality Control (QC) Processes
------------------------------

* **QC Procedures**: Surveys were spot-checked during the data collection time frame.
  Only a small percentage of surveys were randomly checked each week as the process
  was manual. When checked, surveys were checked for the presence of response. When
  no response were provided, RA's were contacted to confirm whether or not surveys had
  gone out to the participants as intended.

* **Common Issues Identified**: Common issues identified during the QC proceeses
  included surveys that had no responses. Sometimes this was human error (preferred
  contact or prefereed method of communication not selected by RA) or potentially
  technological malfunction, and sometimes it was caregiver non-response. Caregiver
  non-response was the reason for the majority of the surveys without responses.
  Caregiver non-response was common.
